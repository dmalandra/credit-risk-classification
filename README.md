# Credit Risk Classification

The purpose of this analysis was to use a supervised learning model to predict credit risk.  Information such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt were consolidated to come to a loan status consensus.  Could this machine learning model predict loan status (or credit risk) accurately from the combination of these categories?

Using logistic regression, the supervised learning model predicted loan status with almost perfect accuracy (99%).  Healthy loans were correctly predicted 99.5% of the time, while high-risk loans were correctly predicted with 89% accuracy.
